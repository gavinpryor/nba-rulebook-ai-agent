i. If a coach desires to discuss a rule or interpretation of a rule prior to the start of a game
or between periods, it will be mandatory for the officials to ask the other coach to be present
during the discussion. The same procedure shall be followed if the officials wish to discuss a
game situation with either coach.
j. The designated official shall toss the ball at the start of the game. The crew chief shall
decide whether or not a goal shall count if the officials disagree, and he/she shall decide matters
upon which scorers and timers disagree.

possible moment.
Section IV�Different Decisions by Officials
a. The crew chief shall have the authority to set aside or question decisions regarding a
rule interpretation made by either of the other officials.
b. If two officials give conflicting signals as to who caused the ball to go out-of-
bounds, they will conference and reconstruct the play in an attempt to make the correct call. If
no resolution is reached, a jump ball will be signaled between the two players involved at the
nearest circle. If the two players cannot be identified, the jump ball shall be administered at the
center circle between any two opponents in the game. If one official signals and another
official clearly knows the call is incorrect, they should conference and the calling official
may change the call on the information given. However, if both officials are adamant about their
ruling, a jump ball should be held similar to above.
c. In the event that a violation and foul occur at the same time, the foul will take
precedence.
d. Double Foul (See Rule 12B, Section VI(f)).
e. If the two officials differ on a block/charge foul involving the restricted area and/
or lower defensive box, they will conference and share information in an attempt to make the
correct call. If no resolution is reached it will be treated as a double foul (See Rule 12B, Section
VI(f)).
EXCEPTION: Last two minutes of fourth period and last two minutes of overtime. (See
Rule 13, Section I(a)(11))
Section V�Time and Place for Decisions
a. The officials have the power to render decisions for infractions of rules committed
inside or outside the boundary lines. This includes periods when the game may be stopped
for any reason.
b. When a personal foul or violation occurs, an official will blow his/her whistle to
terminate play. The whistle is the signal for the timer to stop the game clock. If a personal
foul has occurred, the official will indicate the number of the offender to the official scorer,
the type of foul committed and the number of free throws, if any, to be attempted or indicate
the spot of the throw-in.
If a violation has occurred the official will indicate (1) the nature of the violation by giving
the correct signal, (2) the number of the offender, if applicable, and (3) the direction in which
the ball will be advanced.
- 11 -c. When a team is entitled to a throw-in, an official shall clearly signal (1) the act
which caused the ball to become dead, (2) the spot of the throw-in, and (3) the team entitled to
the throw-in, unless it follows a successful field goal or free throw.
d. When a whistle is erroneously sounded, whether the ball is in a possession or
non- possession status, it is an inadvertent whistle and shall be interpreted as a suspension-
of-play.
e. An official may suspend play for any unusual circumstance (See Rule 4,
Section XIV).
Section VI�Correcting Errors
A. Free Throws
Officials may correct an error if a rule is inadvertently set aside and results in the
following:
(1) A team not shooting a merited free throw that will remain in play.
EXCEPTION: If the offensive team scores or shoots earned free throws as a result of a
personal foul prior to possession by the defensive team, the error shall be ignored if more
than 24 seconds has expired.
(2) A team not shooting a merited free throw that will not remain in play. The error shall
be corrected, all play shall stand and play will resume from the point of interruption with
the clocks remaining the same.
(3) A team shooting an unmerited free throw.
(4) Permitting the wrong player to attempt a free throw.
Officials shall administer the above cases as follows:
a. Officials shall be notified of a possible error at the first dead ball.
b. Errors which occur in the first or third periods must be discovered and rectified prior
to the start of the next period.
c. Errors which occur in the second period must be discovered and the scorer�s table
notified prior to the officials leaving the floor at the end of the period. The error(s) must be
rectified prior to the start of the third period.
d. Errors which occur in the fourth period or overtime(s) must be discovered and rectified
prior to the end of the period.
e. The ball is not in play on corrected free throw attempt(s). Play is resumed at the same
spot and under the same conditions as would have prevailed had the error not been discovered.
f. All play that occurs is to be nullified if the error is discovered within a 24-second time
period. The game clock shall be reset to the time that the error occurred.
EXCEPTION: Acts of unsportsmanlike conduct and all flagrant fouls, and points scored
therefrom, shall not be nullified.
EXCEPTION: If the error to be corrected is for a free throw attempt where there is to be
no line-up of players on the free throw lane (technical foul, defensive three seconds, flopping,
flagrant foul, clear path-to-the-basket foul, transition take foul, punching foul, away-from-the-
play foul), the error shall be corrected, all play shall stand, and play shall resume from the point
of interruption with the clocks remaining the same.
- 12 -B. Lineup Positions
In any jump ball situation, if the jumpers lined up incorrectly, and the error is discovered:
(1) After more than 24 seconds has elapsed, the teams will continue to shoot for that
basket for the remainder of that half and/or overtime. If the error is discovered in the first half,
teams will shoot at the proper basket as decided by the opening tap for the second half.
(2) If 24 seconds or less has elapsed, all play shall be nullified.
EXCEPTION: Acts of unsportsmanlike conduct, all flagrant fouls, and points scored
therefrom, shall not be nullified and play will resume from the original jump ball with players
facing the proper direction.
C. Throw-In
If the second, third or fourth period or any throw-in begins with the wrong team being
awarded possession or the teams facing in the wrong direction, and the error is discovered:
(1) after 24 seconds has elapsed, the error cannot be corrected.
(2) with 24 seconds or less having elapsed, all play shall be nullified.
EXCEPTION: Acts of unsportsmanlike conduct, all flagrant fouls, and points scored
therefrom, shall not be nullified.
D. Record Keeping
A record keeping error by the official scorer which involves the score, number of
personal fouls, team fouls and/or timeouts may be corrected by the officials at any time prior
to the end of the fourth period. Any such error which occurs in overtime must be corrected
prior to the end of that period.
Section VII�Duties of Scorers
a. The scorers shall record the field goals and free throws made and missed and shall
keep a running summary of the points scored. They shall record the personal and technical fouls
called on each player and shall notify the officials immediately when a sixth personal foul, or
second unsportsmanlike technical foul, is called on any player. They shall record the timeouts
charged to each team, shall notify a team and its coach through an official whenever that team
is granted its final timeout, and shall notify the nearest official each time a team is granted a
charged timeout in excess of the legal number. They shall also record if and when a team uses a
Coach�s Challenge and the impact of the Challenge, if any, on the number of timeouts remaining
for the challenging team (See Rule 14). In case there is a question about an error in the scoring,
the scorer shall check with the crew chief at once to find the discrepancy. If the error cannot be
found, the official shall accept the record of the official scorer, unless he/she has knowledge that
forces him/her to decide otherwise.
b. The scorers shall keep a record of the names, numbers and positions of the players
who are to start the game and of all substitutes who enter the game. When there is an infraction
of the rules pertaining to submission of the active list, substitutions or numbers of players,
they shall notify the nearest official immediately if the ball is dead, or as soon as it
becomes dead if it is in play when the infraction is discovered. The scorer shall mark the
time at which players are disqualified by reason of receiving six personal fouls, so that it
may be easy to ascertain the order in which the players are eligible to go back into the game in
accordance with Rule 3, Section I.
c. The scorers shall ask the timer to sound the horn to signal the officials. This may
be used when the ball is dead or in certain specified situations when the ball is in control of
a given team.
- 13 -When a player is disqualified from the game, or whenever a penalty free throw is being
awarded, the timer will sound the horn to notify the game officials. It is the duty of the
scorekeeper to inform the timer to sound the horn and be certain that the officials have
acknowledged a player�s sixth personal foul and/or the penalty is in effect.
d. The scorer shall not signal the officials while the ball is in play, except to notify
them of the necessity to correct an error.
e. Should the scorer sound the horn while the ball is in play, it shall be ignored by the
players on the court. The officials must use their judgment in stopping play to consult with
the scorer�s table.
f. Scorers shall record on the scoreboard the number of team fouls up to a total of five,
which will indicate that the team is in a penalty situation.
g. Scorers shall, immediately, record the name of the team which secures the first
possession of the game.
Section VIII�Duties of Timers
a. The timers shall note when each half is to start and shall notify the crew chief and
both coaches five minutes before this time, or cause them to be notified at least five minutes
before the half is to start. They shall signal the scorers two minutes before starting time. They
shall record playing time and time of stoppages as provided in the rules. The official timer
and the shot clock operator shall be provided with digital stop watches to be used in case the
official timeout, game clock, and/or shot clocks/game clocks located above the backboards fail
to work properly.
b. At the beginning of the first period, any overtime period, or whenever play is resumed
by a jump ball, the game clock shall be started when the ball is legally tapped by either of the
jumpers. The shot clock will be started when player possession of the ball is obtained. No time
will be removed from the game clock and/or shot clock if the ball is not legally touched before
a violation.
c. If the game clock has been stopped and the ball is put in play by a throw-in, the
game clock and the shot clock shall be started when the ball is legally touched by any player
on the court. The starting of the game clock and the shot clock will be under the control of the
official timer.
d. During an unsuccessful free throw attempt, the game clock will be started when the
ball is legally touched. The shot clock will be started when player possession of the ball is
obtained.
e. The game clock shall be stopped at the expiration of time for each period and when
an official sounds his/her whistle. The timers shall record only the actual playing time in the last
minute of the first, second, and third periods. They shall record only the actual playing time in
the last two minutes of the fourth period and the last two minutes of any overtime period(s).
f. For a charged timeout, the timer shall start the Time-out Clock immediately after an
official signals for a timeout and play will not resume until the Time-out Clock has expired.
g. The game clock and the scoreboard will combine to cause a horn to sound,
automatically, when playing time for the period has expired. If the horn or buzzer fails to sound,
or is not heard, the official timer shall use any other means to notify the officials immediately.
h. In a dead ball situation, if the clock shows :00.0, the period or game is considered to
have ended although the horn may not have sounded.
EXCEPTION: See Rule 13
- 14 -RULE NO. 3�PLAYERS, SUBSTITUTES, AND COACHES
Section I�Team
a. Each team shall consist of five players. A player is disqualified from the game when
he receives his sixth personal foul. No team may be reduced to less than five players. If
a player in the game receives his sixth personal foul and all substitutes have already been
disqualified, said player shall remain in the game and shall be charged with a personal and
team foul. A technical foul also shall be assessed against his team. All subsequent personal
fouls, including offensive fouls, shall be treated similarly. All players who have six or more
personal fouls and remain in the game shall be treated similarly.
b. In the event that there are only five eligible players remaining and one of these
players is injured and must leave the game or is ejected, he must be replaced by the last player
who was disqualified by reason of receiving six personal fouls. Each subsequent requirement
to replace an injured or ejected player will be treated in this inverse order. Any such re-entry
into a game by a disqualified player shall be penalized by a technical foul.
c. In the event that a player leaves the playing court while the ball is in play, play will
continue until the next stoppage of play and the player will be replaced if he is not ready to
return. No technical foul will be assessed, but the incident will be reviewed by the League
Office for a possible fine and/or suspension.
EXCEPTION: Rule 10, Section XV
Section II�Starting Line-Ups
At least 30 minutes before the game is scheduled to begin, the scorers shall be supplied
with the name and number of each player who will start the game. Failure to comply with this
provision shall be reported to the League Office.
Section III�The Captain
a. A team may have a captain and a co-captain numbering a maximum of two. The

goal. The act of shooting starts when, in the official�s judgment, the player has started his
shooting motion and continues until the shooting motion ceases and he returns to a normal
floor position. For jump shots, the shooting motion starts when the offensive player starts to
bring the ball upward towards the basket. On drives to the basket or other moving shots, the
shooting motion starts when the player gathers the ball and continues through with a shot
(except during a take foul situation when the clocks are not expiring, the shooting begins
when the player�s shoulders start upward). It is not essential that the ball leave the shooter�s
hand. His arm(s) might be held so that he cannot actually make an attempt.
The term is also used to include the flight of the ball until it becomes dead or is touched
by a player. A tap during a jump ball or rebound is not considered a field goal attempt. How-
ever, anytime a live ball is in flight toward the rim from the playing court, the goal, if made,
shall count, even if time expires or the official�s whistle sounds. The field goal will not be
scored if time on the game clock expires before the ball leaves the player�s hand or the ball
is in flight toward the rim.

A throw-in is a method of putting the ball in play from out-of-bounds in accordance

inadvertent whistle, instant replay review, re-setting the timing devices, or any other unusual
circumstance. During such a suspension, neither team is permitted to substitute and the defensive
team may not be granted a timeout. Play shall be resumed at the point of interruption (i.e., where
the ball is located when the whistle sounds); except that, when neither team has possession
of the ball at the time of the whistle, a team shall be awarded possession if, at the time of the
whistle, such team clearly and conclusively would have imminently gained possession of the
ball, as determined by (1) the proximity of opposing player(s) to the ball (or lack thereof), and
(2) the actual outcome of the play in the natural and immediate aftermath of the whistle.
EXCEPTIONS:
(1) Suspension of play for a player bleeding. See Comments on the Rules, Section II(N).

and recovers it without moving his pivot foot and before the ball touches the floor, he retains
his status before the fumble.

which to attempt a field goal. If the shot clock reads 0, a shot clock violation has occurred,
even though the horn may not have sounded.
i. If during any period there are 24 seconds OR LESS left to play in the period, the
shot clock shall not function following a change of possession; provided, however, the shot
clock shall be reactivated and reset to 14 seconds when any of the situations described in

Section I�Player
The player is out-of-bounds when he touches the floor or any object on or outside a
boundary. For location of a player in the air, his position is that from which he last touched
the floor. The last part of the foot/feet which is in contact with the floor on his last step prior
to jumping over the midcourt line or three-point line shall determine his location.
Section II�Ball
a. The ball is out-of-bounds when it touches a player who is out-of-bounds or any
other person, the floor, or any object on, above, or outside of a boundary or the supports or
back of the backboard.

enters the cylinder from below is considered out-of-bounds.
c. The ball is caused to go out-of-bounds by the last player to touch it (including by
touching the player�s hair or uniform) before it goes out, provided it is out-of-bounds because
of touching something other than a player. If the ball is out-of-bounds because of touching
a player who is on or outside a boundary, such player caused it to go out. If a player has his
hand in contact with the ball and an opponent hits that part of the hand causing the ball to go
out-of-bounds, the team whose player had his hand on the ball will retain possession.
d. If the ball goes out-of-bounds and was last touched simultaneously by two
opponents, both of whom are inbounds or out-of-bounds, or if the official is in doubt as to
who last touched the ball, or if the officials disagree, play shall be resumed by a jump ball
between the two involved players in the nearest restraining circle.
EXCEPTION: Rule 6, Section V(a)(10)
e. If the ball is interfered with by an opponent seated on the bench or standing on the
sideline (Rule 12A, Section II(a)(7)), it shall be awarded to the offended team out-of- bounds
nearest the spot of the violation.
Section III�The Throw-In
a. The throw-in starts when the ball is given to the player entitled to the throw-in. He
shall release the ball within 5 seconds from the time he receives the ball and controls it. Until
the passed ball has crossed the plane of the boundary, no player shall have any part of his
person over the boundary line and teammates shall not occupy positions parallel or adjacent
- 30 -to the baseline if an opponent desires one of those positions. The defensive man shall have
the right to be between his man and the basket.
b. On a throw-in which goes out-of-bounds and is not touched by a player in the game,
the ball is returned to the original throw-in spot.
c. After a score, field goal, or free throw, the latter coming as the result of a personal
foul, any player of the team not credited with the score shall put the ball into play from any
point out-of-bounds at the endline of the court where the point(s) were scored. He may pass
the ball to a teammate behind the endline; however, the five-second throw-in rule applies.
This rule also applies to the player of the team with possession at the start of the second,
third, and fourth periods.
d. After a free throw violation by the shooter or his teammate, the throw-in is made
from out-of-bounds on either side of the free throw line extended.
e. Any ball out-of-bounds in a team�s frontcourt or at the midcourt line cannot be
passed into the backcourt. On all backcourt and midcourt violations, the ball shall be awarded
to the opposing team at the midcourt line, and must be passed into the frontcourt.
EXCEPTION: During the last two minutes of the fourth period and the last two minutes
of any overtime period, the ball may be passed anywhere (frontcourt or backcourt) on the
court. However, if the ball is thrown into the frontcourt and an offensive player on the court
fails to control the ball and causes it to go into the backcourt, his team may not be the first
to touch the ball.
f. A throw-in which touches the floor, or any object, on or outside the boundary line,
or touches anything above the playing surface is a violation. The ball must be thrown directly
inbounds.

team shall inbound on either sideline at the free throw line extended. If both teams commit a
violation during this free throw, a jump ball shall be administered at midcourt between any two
opponents in the game. If the opponent�s violation is disconcertion, then a substitute free
throw shall be awarded.

If the free throw attempt is not to remain in play, then play will continue from that point.
d. During a free throw attempt for a common foul, each of the spaces nearest the end-
line must be occupied by an opponent of the free throw shooter. Teammates of the free throw
shooter must occupy the next adjacent spaces on each side. Only one of the third spaces may
be occupied by an opponent of the free throw shooter. It is not mandatory that either of the
third spaces be occupied by an opponent but may not be occupied by a teammate. If there is a
discrepancy, teammates of the free throw shooter will occupy the spaces first.
Players occupying lane spaces may not extend themselves over their lane spaces in front
of an opponent or be touching the lane line or floor inside the line when the ball is released
by the shooter. They may not vacate their lane space more than 3� from the lane line before
the ball is released.
Players not occupying lane spaces must remain on the court behind the three point line
above the free throw line extended and may not be touching the line or floor inside the line
when the ball is released.
PENALTY:

point can be scored and the opposing team will inbound on either sideline at the free throw
line extended. If an opponent violates, the shooter shall receive a substitute free throw if
his attempt is unsuccessful but shall be ignored if the attempt is successful. If a teammate
and opponent both violate, a jump ball shall be administered at midcourt between any two
opponents in the game.

occupy positions along the free throw lanes. All players must remain on the court behind the
three point line above the free throw line extended until the ball is released.

advantage is gained unless there is a disconcertion violation by an opponent to which a
substitute free throw will be awarded.
f. During all free throw attempts, no opponent in the game shall disconcert the shooter
once the ball is placed at his disposal. The following are acts of disconcertion:
(1) Raising his arms when positioned on the lane line on a free throw which will not
remain in play,
(2) Waving his arms or making a sudden movement when in the visual field of the
shooter during any free throw attempt,

line extended. If an opponent violates, one point shall be scored and an additional free throw
shall be awarded the same shooter.

In the event that multiple players on a team are suspended for leaving the bench, and if
necessary in order for the team to have the requisite number of players eligible and able to play in
a game, the suspensions will be served over multiple games (e.g., with some players suspended
for the first game following the altercation and other players suspended for the second game
following the altercation), with the players serving their suspensions alphabetically, according
to the first letters of their last names.

ejected from the game, must leave the playing area IMMEDIATELY and remain in the dressing
room of his/her team during such suspension until completion of the game or leave the building.

ring shall be assessed a non-unsportsmanlike technical foul and a fine of at least $2,000.

two-point or three-point field goal or, in the case of a shooting foul, whether the
shooter fouled was attempting a two-point or three-point field goal.
(5) Whether the shooter committed a boundary line violation or the ball touched out-
of-bounds prior to entering the basket or, in the case of a foul, whether the player
fouled committed a boundary line violation. For purposes of this review, the Replay
Center Official would look only at the position of the player�s feet at the moment they
last touched the floor immediately prior to (or, if applicable, during) the release of the
shot or the foul (as applicable).
(6) Whether an 8-second backcourt violation occurred before the ball left the
shooter�s hand or the player was fouled.
(7) Whether any unsportsmanlike acts or unnecessary contact occurred.
(8) In the case of a foul, whether a flopping violation proximate to the called foul
should be assessed or rescinded.
h. If an instant replay review is triggered as described in Section I(a)(8) above, the
Replay Center Official and the official who called the foul would review the video to deter-
mine whether:
(1) When the foul was called, the ball is ahead of the tip of the circle in the backcourt,
no defender is ahead of the offensive player with the scoring opportunity and that
offensive player is in control of the ball or a pass to him has been released.
(2) The foul deprived the offensive team of a transition scoring opportunity.
(3) The foul was committed prior to the offensive player starting his shooting motion.
(4) The foul was caused by the defender�s attempt to intercept or deflect a pass intended
for the player with the transition scoring opportunity.
(5) Any unsportsmanlike acts or unnecessary contact occurred.
(6) Whether a flopping violation proximate to the called foul should be assessed or
rescinded.
- 55 -i. If an instant replay review is triggered in Section I(a)(9) above, the Replay Center
Official and the official who called the foul will review the video to determine which player
was fouled. The review must take place prior to the first free throw being released. The
Officials would not review video to determine which player committed the foul in question.
The Replay Center Official and on-court officials may review the video to determine only
the following other matters:
(1) Whether the shooter fouled was attempting a two-point or three-point field goal.
(2) Whether the player fouled committed a boundary line violation prior to the foul.
For purposes of this review, the official will look only at the position of the
player�s feet at the moment they last touched the floor immediately prior to (or,
if applicable, during) the foul.
(3) Whether the shot clock expired before the foul occurred.
(4) Whether an 8-second backcourt violation occurred before the player was fouled.
(5) Whether any unsportsmanlike acts or unnecessary contact occurred.
(6) Whether a flopping violation proximate to the called foul should be assessed or
rescinded.
j. If an instant replay review is triggered in Section I(a)(10) above, the Replay Center
Official will review the video to determine whether the ball touched the rim, and make
any adjustments to the game clock, shot clock, score, and possession that are appropriate in
accordance with the following:
(1) If play has stopped following the offensive team retaining possession (e.g., the
offensive team has made a successful field goal, or a violation or foul has been
called), the play must be reviewed immediately upon such stoppage of play and:
(i) For a successful field goal, the Replay Center Official will time the play to
determine whether the field goal was released prior to the expiration of the 24
second shot clock. If the Replay Center Official determines that the ball was
released before the shot clock expired, the points will count and the opposing
team will inbound on the baseline as after any successful field goal. If the
Replay Center Official determines that the ball was released after the shot
clock should have expired, the points will not count and the opposing team
will be awarded the ball at the free throw line extended.
(ii) For a called foul, the Replay Center Official and official who called the
foul will time the play to determine whether the foul occurred prior to the
expiration of the shot clock or, in the case of a called foul that is committed
on a player in the act of shooting, whether the shooter released the ball
prior to the expiration of the shot clock. If the Replay Center Official and
official determines that the foul occurred or the ball was released prior to
the expiration of the shot clock, the called foul will be upheld. If the Replay
Center Official determines that the foul occurred or the ball was released after
the expiration of the shot clock, the called foul will be overturned and a shot
clock violation assessed. (EXCEPTION: Flagrant fouls and unsportsmanlike
acts and points scored therefrom will not be nullified.)
(iii) If the ball is caused to become out-of-bounds by the defensive team or a
defensive violation is assessed, the Replay Center Official will time the play
to determine how much time should be on the shot clock or if a shot clock
violation should be assessed.
(2) If play is continuous (i.e., if there is no stoppage in play following the offensive
team retaining possession of the ball), the officials will stop play during the first pause
- 56 -in action prior to any subsequent change of possession. If the Replay Center Official
determines following the review that the shot clock is correct (i.e., no adjustment is
required), then play will resume from the point of interruption. If the Replay Center
Official determines that the shot clock is incorrect, then the shot clock will be reset to
the time the ball was possessed by the offensive team following the ball touching (or
not touching) the rim, and the game clock will also be reset to reflect the change. The
ball will be inbounded on the sideline nearest the spot where the ball was possessed.
(3) If play is stopped while neither team is in possession of the ball and the Replay
Center Official determines following the review that a shot clock violation has not
occurred, then possession shall be awarded to a team if, at the time of the whistle,
such team clearly and conclusively would have imminently gained possession of
the ball, as determined by (1) the proximity of opposing player(s) to the ball (or
lack thereof), and (2) the actual outcome of the play in the natural and immediate
aftermath of the whistle.
(4) Whether any unsportsmanlike acts or unnecessary contact occurred.
If an instant replay review for a shot clock adjustment is not reviewed in accordance
with the timing rules set forth above, it may not be reviewed at any point thereafter.
The Replay Center Official will have the final ruling on all other scenarios and clock
adjustments.
k. If an instant replay review is triggered as described in Section I(a)(11) above, the
Replay Center Official and the official who called the foul will review the video to determine:
(1) Whether the defender was inside or outside the restricted area.
(2) Whether the defender was in a legal guarding position.
(3) Whether any unsportsmanlike acts or unnecessary contact occurred.
(4) Whether a flopping violation proximate to the called foul should be assessed or
rescinded.
l. If an instant replay review is triggered as described in Section I(a)(12) above, the
Replay Center Official would review the video in accordance with Rule 11, Section I. The
Replay Center Official and on-court officials(s) may also review the video to determine only
the following other matters:
(1) If goaltending or basket interference was ruled prior to the ball touching the rim,
whether the shooter committed a boundary line violation. For purposes of this review,
the Replay Center Official will look only at the position of the shooter�s feet at the
moment they last touched the floor immediately prior to (or, if applicable, during) the
release of the shot and the flight of the ball.
(2) If goaltending or basket interference was ruled prior to the ball touching the rim,
whether an 8-second backcourt violation occurred before the ball left the shooter�s hand.
(3) Whether any unsportsmanlike acts or unnecessary contact occurred.
If the instant replay review results in the call on the floor being overturned, play is
resumed at the point of interruption (as defined in Rule 4, Section XIV).
m. If an instant replay review is triggered as described in Section I(a)(13) above, the
Replay Center Official and the official who called the foul will review the video to determine:
(1) Whether the shot clock expired before the foul occurred.
(2) Whether an 8-second backcourt violation occurred before the player was fouled.
(3) Whether any unsportsmanlike acts or unnecessary contact occurred.
(4) Whether a flopping violation proximate to the called foul should be assessed or
rescinded.
- 57 -n. If an instant replay review is triggered as described in Section I(a)(14) above, the
Replay Center Official would review the video in accordance with Rule 12A, Section III. The
Replay Center Official and on-court official(s) may also review the video to determine
whether any unsportsmanlike acts or unnecessary contact occurred.
o. If an instant replay review is triggered as described in Section I(b)(1), the Replay
Center Official will immediately review the video to determine the following issues:
(1) Whether the successful field goal was scored correctly as a two-point or three-point
field goal.
(2) Whether the shooter fouled was attempting a two-point or three-point field goal.
The Replay Center Official will also review the video to determine only the following
other matters:
(3) Whether the shooter committed a boundary line violation or the ball touched
out-of-bounds prior to entering the basket or, in the case of a foul, whether the
player fouled committed a boundary line violation. For purposes of this review,
the Replay Center Official will look only at the position of the player�s feet at the
moment they last touched the floor immediately prior to (or, if applicable, during)
the release of the shot or the foul (as applicable).
(4) Whether the shot clock expired before the ball left the shooter�s hand or the
foul occurred.
The Replay Center Official�s review must take place within the same time constraints
set forth in Section II(f)(1) above.
p. If an instant replay review is triggered as described in Section I(b)(2) above, the
Replay Center Official will immediately review the video to determine whether time on the
shot clock expired before the ball left the shooter�s hand.
The Replay Center Official may also review the video to determine only the following
other matters:
(1) If the shot was timely, whether the successful field goal was scored correctly as a
two-point or three-point field goal.
(2) Whether the shooter committed a boundary line violation or the ball touched out-
of-bounds prior to entering the basket. For purposes of this review, the Replay Center
Official will look only at the position of the player�s feet at the moment they last
touched the floor immediately prior to (or, if applicable, during) the release of the
shot or the foul (as applicable).
(3) Whether an 8-second backcourt violation occurred before the ball left the shooter�s
hand or the player was fouled.
The Replay Center Official�s review must take place within the same time constraints
set forth in Section II(g)(1) above.
NOTE: For purposes of Section II (b, c, d, f, g, h, i, k, and m) above, the factors that
will be considered in determining whether a prior flopping violation is proximate to the
called foul include (1) whether the player(s) involved in the flopping violation are the
same or different players than the ones involved in the called foul under review, (2) the
distance between the flopping violation, and the called foul under review, and (3) the
time elapsed between the flopping violation, and the called foul under review.
- 58 -Section III�Replay Review Process
a. Except as set forth in Rule 14 below, replay reviews will be triggered by the on-court
game officials and Replay Center Official in accordance with the rules set forth in Section I
above. The Replay Center Official will determine the final outcome on all replays triggered
pursuant to Section I above except Flagrant Fouls and Altercations, which will be decided by the
on-court officials, with personnel in the Replay Center playing a supporting role. In all cases,
the two game officials will inform both team benches that the play will be reviewed. For replay
reviews to be determined by the Replay Center Official, the calling official, and the crew chief at
his/her discretion, will go to the scorer�s table and put on the headset to receive the ruling from
the Replay Center Official and the other on-court official(s) will prepare the players to return to
play. If the ruling is to be made by the on-court officials, the crew chief and a second official will
go to the scorer�s table and make the ruling with the assistance of the Replay Center Official. The
third official will monitor the benches.
b. Replay reviews should be conducted within two minutes. Notwithstanding this
general rule, discretion will be used to extend the review period as reasonably necessary under
unusual circumstances, such as when the play could lead to an ejection (e.g., flagrant fouls/
penalty 2), technical issues arise with the replay system, the outcome of the replay review
requires multiple replay review angles, or additional angles are imminent. In addition, replay
reviews of Altercations should be concluded within whatever time is reasonably necessary, even
if that time period extends beyond two minutes.
c. If the replay system is not functioning properly, or not available, the officials will use
the nearest courtside broadcast production TV monitor available.
d. The Replay Center Official will use the following to make his/her ruling in the order
listed below regarding scoring, timing, or fouls at the end of any period:
(1) Game clock or shot clock on top of backboard
(2) LED lights
(3) Game clock on the facades of the balcony
(4) Game clock on scoreboards hanging from the ceiling
(5) Superimposed TV clocks
EXCEPTION: For clock malfunctions when clocks start early, late, or freeze�the Replay
Center Official will use the digital clock in the Replay Center to make the final ruling.
e. The officials will keep both teams on the court at the end of the second period if replay
is being used to determine if a foul was called prior to expiration of the period or if there is any
question whether the shooter committed a shot clock violation, 8-second violation ,or boundary
line violation where time may be added to the game clock.
f. The officials will keep both teams on the court anytime replay is used at the end of
the fourth period or overtime period.
- 59 -RULE NO. 14�COACH�S CHALLENGE
Section I�Overview
a. A head coach may trigger instant replay review of certain events subject to the terms
and conditions set forth in this rule. Instant replay review triggered pursuant to this rule shall be
referred to as a �Coach�s Challenge� (or �Challenge� for short).
b. Each team is entitled to one Challenge per game. If a team�s first Challenge is
successful, the team will be awarded a second Challenge.
c. A team may utilize a Challenge to trigger instant replay review of only the following
three events: (1) a called personal foul charged to its own team, (2) a called out-of-bounds
violation, or (3) a called goaltending or basket interference violation; provided that, in the last
two minutes of the fourth period and last two minutes of any overtime, a team is no longer
able to utilize a Challenge to trigger instant replay review of a called goaltending or basket
interference violation, as review of these events during these periods will be exclusively
triggered by the on-court game officials.
NOTE: A Coach�s Challenge is the only mechanism to trigger replay review of out-of-
bounds violations at any point during the game.
d. Any called foul, violation, or other decision by the game officials not listed in Section
I(c) above, or any non-call, is not a challengeable event. For clarity, instant replay review of the
following events, among others, may not be triggered by a Challenge: (1) a called personal foul
charged to the opposing team, (2) continuation�e.g., whether a defensive foul occurred prior to
the offensive player beginning his shooting motion, (3) a Technical Foul or Flagrant Foul, and
(4) violations such as traveling, carrying, double dribble, flopping, or an offensive or defensive
three-seconds. As set forth in Section III(a)(3) below, any aspect related to continuation
constitutes a reviewable matter when a called foul is properly challenged, but continuation is
not by itself an independent challengeable event.
Section II�Procedure to Initiate the Challenge
a. To initiate a Challenge, the challenging team must take the following steps in sequence:
(1) The challenging team must call a legal timeout immediately after the call in
question (unless a mandatory timeout or timeout called by the opposing team is
already underway);
(2) The challenging team�s head coach must simultaneously signal for a Challenge
by utilizing the instant replay signal (i.e., twirling an index finger) toward the game
official(s) during the same interaction with the game official(s) in which the timeout
was called or, if the timeout was called by a player on the challenging team, the
challenging team�s head coach must simultaneously signal for the Challenge by
utilizing the instant replay signal toward the game officials as the game official is
notifying the scorekeeper of the timeout; and
(3) During the same interaction with the game official(s) in which the challenging
team�s head coach signaled for the Challenge, the challenging team�s head coach must
notify the game official(s) of the specific event that the team is challenging.
For purposes of this rule only, �immediately� shall mean that a timeout is called prior to
the ball being given to the thrower-in, the ball being given to the free throw shooter, or
the ball being tossed on a jump ball, whichever is applicable (unless a mandatory timeout
or timeout called by the opposing team is already underway).
b. To initiate a Challenge of an event that immediately preceded a mandatory timeout or
timeout called by the opposing team, no later than 30 seconds from the start of the timeout (as
measured by the timeout clock), the challenging team�s head coach must take the following steps
in sequence:
- 60 -(1) Signal for a Challenge by utilizing the instant replay signal toward the game
officials; and
(2) During the same interaction with the game official(s) in which the challenging
team�s head coach signaled for the Challenge, the challenging team�s head coach must
notify the game official(s) of the specific event that the team is challenging.
c. In the event the game officials conference to determine the call on the floor (and, as a
result, the final ruling on the play is unknown for a period of time), the window of time within
which a team must immediately challenge the call starts after the officials notify the negatively
affected team of the final ruling on the play. The negatively affected team�s window to challenge
the final ruling on the play ends when the ball is given to the inbounder or free throw shooter,
jump-ball is tossed, or 30 seconds after the team has been notified of the final ruling on the play in
the event that a mandatory timeout or timeout by the opposing team has been called (whichever
is applicable).
d. A team loses its opportunity to challenge the prior call if it is called for a delay-of-game
after the call in question but prior to calling timeout and simultaneously signaling for a Challenge.
e. Once instant replay review is triggered by a valid Challenge, the official will notify
the official scorer of the Challenge. The official scorer shall immediately record the Challenge
and, once the instant replay review process is complete, the outcome of the Challenge (including
whether the Challenge resulted in a loss of one timeout for the challenging team).
Section III�Reviewable Matters
a. If an instant replay review of a called foul is triggered by a Challenge, the on-court crew
chief will review the video to evaluate whether the foul being challenged was correctly called.
The on-court crew chief may also review the video to determine only the following other
matters:
(1) Whether the correct player (including a player on the opposing team) was called
for the foul;
(2) Whether a different foul proximate to the called foul should have been called;
(3) Any aspect related to continuation, including, but not limited to:
(a) Whether the foul occurred prior to the offensive player beginning his shooting
motion if the foul is committed by a defensive player;
(b) Whether a made basket that the on-court game officials counted shall not
count because an offensive player committed a violation after the offensive player
gathered the ball; and
(c) Whether a made basket disallowed by the on-court game officials shall count
because the shot constituted legal continuation.
(4) Whether a goaltending or basket interference violation occurred on the play;
(5) Whether the game clock expired prior to the foul;
(6) Whether the shot clock expired prior to the foul;
(7) If an offensive player was fouled while in possession of the ball, whether the player
who was fouled committed a boundary line violation either just prior to or after the foul;
(8) Whether an 8-second backcourt violation occurred before the player was fouled; and
(9) Whether any unsportsmanlike acts or unnecessary contact occurred.
(10) Whether a flopping violation proximate to the called foul should be assessed or
rescinded.
NOTE: For purposes of Section III (a) (2 and 10) above, the factors that will be
considered in determining whether a prior uncalled foul and/or flopping violation is
- 61 -proximate to the called foul include (1) whether the players involved in the uncalled
foul and/or flopping violation are the same or different players than the ones involved
in the called foul under review, (2) the distance between the uncalled foul and/or
flopping violation, and the called foul under review, and (3) the time elapsed between
the uncalled foul and/or flopping violation, and the called foul under review.
b. If an instant replay review of an out-of-bounds violation is triggered by a Challenge,
the Replay Center Official will review the video to evaluate whether the out-of-bounds violation
was correctly called.
The Replay Center Official may also review the video to determine only the following
other matters:
(1) Whether the game clock expired prior to the ball being out-of-bounds;
(2) Whether the shot clock expired prior to the ball being out-of-bounds;
(3) Whether an 8-second backcourt violation occurred prior to the ball being out-of-
bounds;
(4) How much time remains in the period and/or on the shot clock;
(5) Whether any unsportsmanlike acts or unnecessary contact occurred; and
(6) If the out-of-bounds violation called on the floor is overturned and that call
occurred simultaneous to a successful shot attempt by the offensive player, whether
the whistle sounded before or after the player started his shooting motion (See Rule
14, Section VI).
c. If an instant replay review of a goaltending or basket interference violation is triggered
by a Challenge, the Replay Center Official will review the video to evaluate whether the call on
the floor was correct.
The Replay Center Official may also review the video to determine only the following
other matters:
(1) If goaltending or basket interference was ruled prior to the ball touching the rim,
whether the shooter committed a boundary line violation; provided that, for purposes
of this review, the Replay Center Official will look only at the position of the shooter�s
feet at the moment they last touched the floor immediately prior to (or, if applicable,
during) the release of the shot and the flight of the ball;
(2) If goaltending or basket interference was ruled prior to the ball touching the rim,
whether an 8-second backcourt violation occurred before the ball left the shooter�s
hand; and
(3) Whether any unsportsmanlike acts or unnecessary contact occurred.
Section IV�Replay Review Process
a. The on-court crew chief will determine the final outcome when instant replay review
of a called foul is triggered by a Challenge, with personnel in the Replay Center playing a
supporting role.
b. The Replay Center Official will determine the final outcome when instant replay
review of a called out-of-bounds violation or called goaltending or basket interference violation
is triggered by a Challenge.
EXCEPTION: For pre-season or regular season games conducted outside an NBA arena,
the on-court crew chief will determine the final outcome of any replay review triggered by a
Challenge.
c. To overturn a challenged event or to change the outcome of a reviewable matter via a
Challenge, there must be clear and conclusive visual evidence that the initial adjudication of that
aspect of the play was incorrect.
- 62 -d. Once the instant replay review process is triggered by a Challenge, the on-court crew
chief or Replay Center Official (as appropriate) shall arrive at one of two determinations with
respect to the call that was challenged:
(1) The call stands (i.e., there is not clear and conclusive visual evidence that the call
was incorrect); or
(2) The call is overturned (i.e., there is clear and conclusive visual evidence that the
call was incorrect).
Section V�Impact on Timeouts
a. If the call subject to review pursuant to a Challenge is not overturned, the Challenge is
deemed unsuccessful and the challenging team loses its timeout.
b. If the call subject to review pursuant to a team�s first Challenge is overturned, the
Challenge is deemed successful and the challenging team retains its timeout unless the timeout
taken in conjunction with the Challenge initiated a mandatory timeout, and is awarded a second
Challenge.
If a Challenge is utilized to trigger instant replay review of a called foul, that challenge shall
only be deemed successful if the called foul is overturned (i.e., not assigned to the player who was
originally called for the foul) because the review results in either:
(1) No foul assigned to any player (including if the foul was overturned because a
reviewable violation occurred prior to the foul); or
(2) A foul assigned to a different player (including a different player on the challenging
team).
If a Challenge is utilized to trigger instant replay review of a called foul, that challenge
shall be deemed unsuccessful if the foul remains assigned to the player originally called for the
foul regardless of whether any other reviewable matters are changed to the challenging team�s
benefit. For the sake of clarity, it shall be deemed an unsuccessful Challenge if a called foul is
not overturned but changed from a shooting foul (that would have resulted in free throws for the
opposing team) to a non-shooting foul (that does not result in free throws for the opposing team).
If a team utilizes its second Challenge, the challenging team will not retain the timeout used
to initiate its second Challenge even if the Challenge is successful.
c. If a team utilizes a Challenge to trigger instant replay review of an event that immediately
preceded the challenging team�s mandatory timeout, the challenging team will lose its mandatory
timeout (even if the Challenge is successful). If the Challenge is unsuccessful, the challenging
team will only be charged one timeout (i.e., it will not be charged a timeout for both the mandatory
timeout and the Challenge).
d. If a team utilizes its first Challenge to trigger instant replay review of an event that
preceded the opposing team�s mandatory timeout, the team that is ultimately charged with the
timeout depends on whether the Challenge is successful:
(1) If the Challenge is unsuccessful, the challenging team will be assigned the
timeout and, notwithstanding that the Challenge coincided with the opposing team�s
mandatory timeout, the opposing team will not be charged for the timeout (and, if
another mandatory timeout is remaining in the period, the next mandatory timeout will
be assigned to the opposing team); and
(2) If the Challenge is successful, the challenging team will not be assigned a timeout
and the opposing team will be charged with the timeout.
If a team utilizes its second Challenge to trigger instant replay review of an event that
preceded the opposing team�s mandatory timeout, the challenging team will be assigned the
timeout (even if the Challenge is successful).
- 63 -e. If a team utilizes its first Challenge to trigger instant replay review of an event that
preceded a timeout called by the opposing team, the team that is ultimately charged with the
timeout depends on whether the Challenge is successful:
(1) If the Challenge is unsuccessful, the challenging team will be assigned the timeout
and, notwithstanding that the opposing team initially called the timeout, the opposing
team will not be charged for the timeout; and
(2) If the Challenge is successful, the challenging team will not be assigned a timeout
and the opposing team will be charged with the timeout.
If a team utilizes its second Challenge to trigger instant replay review of an event that
preceded a timeout called by the opposing team, the challenging team will be assigned the
timeout (even if the Challenge is successful).
f. If a team attempts to utilize a Challenge to trigger instant replay review of an event when
that team has no remaining timeouts, no Challenge will take place, and that team shall be charged
with an excessive timeout, for which the penalty is a Technical Foul.
g. If a team attempts to utilize a Challenge to trigger instant replay of an event that may not
be reviewed, the team will be charged a timeout but retain its Challenge.
Section VI�Resumption of Play
If a Challenge results in the call on the floor being overturned following instant replay
review, play is resumed at the point of interruption (as defined in Rule 4, Section XIV).
For purposes of this rule only, the point of interruption is where the ball is located when the
whistle sounds; provided that:
(1) If the defensive team utilizes a Challenge to trigger instant replay review of a
defensive foul that occurred after an offensive player started his shooting motion on
a successful shot attempt, and the defensive foul itself is overturned after the replay
review, the basket shall count (regardless of when the whistle sounded) and the
defensive team is awarded the ball to start the next possession; and
(2) If the offensive team utilizes a Challenge to trigger instant replay review of an out-
of-bounds violation that occurred simultaneous to a successful shot attempt by the
offensive player and the whistle sounded after the offensive player started his shooting
motion, and the out-of-bounds violation is overturned after replay review, the basket
shall count and the defensive team is awarded the ball to start the next possession.
- 64 -COMMENTS ON THE RULES
I. GUIDES FOR ADMINISTRATION AND APPLICATION OF THE RULES
Each official should have a definite and clear conception of their overall responsibilities.
It is essential for them to know, understand and implement the rules as intended. If all officials
possess the same conception, there will be a guaranteed uniformity in the administration of
all contests.
The restrictions placed upon the player by the rules are intended to create a balance
of play, equal opportunity for the defense and the offense, provide reasonable safety and
protection for all players and emphasize cleverness and skill without unduly limiting freedom
of action of player or team.
The purpose of penalties is to compensate a player who has been placed at a disadvantage
through an illegal act of an opponent and to restrain players from committing acts which,
if ignored, might lead to roughness even though they do not affect the immediate play.
II. BASIC PRINCIPLES
A. CONTACT SITUATIONS
1. Incidental Contact
The mere fact that contact occurs does not necessarily constitute a foul. Contact which
is incidental to an effort by a player to play an opponent, reach a loose ball, or perform
normal defensive or offensive movements, should not be considered illegal. If, however, a
player attempts to play an opponent from a position where he has no reasonable chance to
perform without making contact with his opponent, the responsibility is on the player in this
position.
The hand is considered �part of the ball� when it is in contact with the ball. Therefore,
contact on that part of the hand by a defender while it is in contact with the ball is not illegal.
2. Guarding an Opponent
In all guarding situations, a player is entitled to any spot on the court he desires,
provided he legally gets to that spot first and without contact with an opponent. If a defensive
or offensive player has established a position on the floor and his opponent initiates contact
that results in the dislodging of the opponent, a foul should be called IMMEDIATELY.
During all throw-ins, the defensive player(s) must be allowed to take a position
between his man and the basket.
A player may continue to move after gaining a guarding position in the path of an
opponent provided he is not moving directly or obliquely toward his opponent when contact
occurs. A player is never permitted to move into the path of an opponent after the opponent
has started his upward jumping motion.
A player who extends a hand, forearm, shoulder, hip or leg into the path of an opponent
and thereby causes contact is not considered to have a legal position in the path of an
opponent.
A player is entitled to a vertical position even to the extent of jumping straight-up or
holding his arms above his shoulders, as in post play or when double-teaming in pressing
tactics.
- 65 -Any player who conforms to the above is absolved from responsibility for any contact
by an opponent which may dislodge or tend to dislodge such player from the position which he
has attained and is maintaining legally. If contact occurs, the official must decide whether the
contact is incidental or a foul has been committed.
3. Screening
When a player screens in front of or at the side of a stationary opponent, he may be as
close as he desires providing he does not make contact. His opponent can see him and, there-
fore, is expected to detour around the screen.
If he screens behind a stationary opponent, the opponent must be able to take a normal
step backward without contact. Because the opponent is not expected to see a screener
behind him, the player screened is given latitude of movement. The defender must be given an
opportunity to change direction and avoid contact with the screener.
To screen a moving opponent, the player must stop soon enough to permit his opponent
the opportunity to avoid contact. The distance between the player screening and his opponent
will depend upon the speed at which the players are moving.
If two opponents are moving in the same direction and path, the player who is behind is
responsible for contact. The player in front may stop or slow his pace, but he may not move
backward or sideward into his opponent. The player in front may or may not have the ball.
This situation assumes the two players have been moving in identically the same direction
and path before contact.
4. The Dribble
If the dribbler�s path is blocked, he is expected to pass or shoot; that is, he should not
try to dribble by an opponent unless there is a reasonable chance of getting by without contact.
B. FOULS: FLAGRANT�UNSPORTSMANLIKE
To be unsportsmanlike is to act in a manner unbecoming to the image of professional
basketball. It consists of acts of deceit, disrespect of officials and profanity. The penalty for
such action is a technical foul. Repeated acts shall result in expulsion from the game and a
minimum fine of $2,000.
A flagrant foul�penalty (1) is unnecessary contact committed by a player against an
opponent.
A flagrant foul�penalty (2) is unnecessary and excessive contact committed by a
player against an opponent. It is an unsportsmanlike act and the offender is ejected following
confirmation by instant replay review.
The offender will be subject to a fine not exceeding $100,000 and/or suspension by
the Commissioner.
See Rule 12B, Section IV for interpretation and penalties.
C. BLOCK-CHARGE
A defensive player is permitted to establish a legal guarding position in the path of a
dribbler regardless of his speed and distance.
A defensive player is not permitted to move into the path of an offensive player once he
has started his upward motion to attempt a field goal or pass.
A defensive player must allow a moving player the opportunity to avoid contact when
the offensive player receives a pass outside the lower defensive box. The lower defensive box
is the area between the 3-foot posted-up marks, the bottom tip of the circle and the endline.
- 66 -A defensive player must allow an airborne player the opportunity to land and then avoid
contact when the offensive player is outside the lower defensive box.
A defensive player is permitted to establish a legal guarding position in the path of an
offensive player who receives a pass inside the lower defensive box regardless of his speed
and distance.
A defensive player must allow an airborne player who receives a pass the space to land
when the offensive player is inside the lower defensive box.
A player must allow a moving opponent without the ball the opportunity to avoid
contact if he moves into his path.
The speed of the player will determine the amount of distance an opponent must allow.
If an offensive player causes contact with a defensive player who has established a legal
position, an offensive foul shall be called and no points may be scored. A defensive player
may turn slightly to protect himself, but is never allowed to bend over and submarine an
opponent.
An offensive foul should not be called for charging if the contact is with a secondary
defensive player who has established a defensive position within a designated �restricted
area� near the basket for the purpose of drawing an offensive foul. The offensive player must
take a path directly to the rim. The �restricted area� for this purpose is the area bounded by an
arc with a 4-foot radius measured from the center of the basket ring.
EXCEPTION: Any player may be legally positioned within the �restricted area� if the
offensive player receives the ball within the Lower Defensive Box.
The mere fact that contact occurs on these type of plays, or any other similar play, does
not necessarily mean that a personal foul has been committed. The officials must decide
whether the contact is negligible and/or incidental, judging each situation separately.
An offensive foul shall be assessed if the player initiates contact in a non-basketball
manner (leads with his foot, an unnatural extended knee, etc.).
D. GAME POSTPONEMENT AND CANCELLATIONS
Whether made before a game begins or after a game has begun, the decision to postpone or
cancel a game can only be made by the League Office, after consultation with the affected teams.
The NBA may postpone or cancel a game before the game begins or after the game has
begun for issues related to the condition of the playing court or arena, or a general or forecasted
condition involving weather, travel, civil unrest, natural disaster, public and/or player and staff
health and safety, or another unusual situation.
The factors that the NBA may consider in determining whether to postpone or cancel a
game include:
(1) The whereabouts of teams and game officials (including the efforts that have been
made or can be made to get these participants to the game site).
(2) Whether sufficient team and arena staff are available to operate the arena and
conduct the game.
(3) Input from both teams.
(4) The health, safety, and well-being of game participants, team and arena staff,
and fans.
(5) Input from health, facilities, security, or other experts, when appropriate.
(6) Input from players involved.
(7) Communications with and/or mandates by state or local government officials and
law enforcement.
- 67 -(8) The ability to reschedule the game, including with consideration for impact to the
league-wide schedule, competitive fairness, and league and team business opportunities.
(9) Any other factor that the NBA deems relevant to the decision.
In the event of a situation that arises after a game has begun, the game officials have the
authority to decide whether to temporarily delay the game while the decision to postpone or
cancel is being made by the NBA.
E. PHYSICAL CONTACT�SUSPENSION
Any player or coach guilty of intentional physical contact with an official shall
automatically be suspended without pay for one game. A fine and/or longer period of suspension
will result if circumstances so dictate.
F. PROTEST
Protests are not permitted during the course of a game. In order to file a protest, the
procedure, as set forth in the NBA Constitution, is as follows: �In order to protest against or
appeal from the result of a game, notice thereof must be given to the Commissioner within forty-
eight (48) hours after the conclusion of said game, by a Writing, stating therein the grounds for
such protest. No protest may be filed in connection with any game played during the Regular
Season after midnight of the day of the last game of the regular schedule, or, for a game played
on the last day of the Regular Season, more than ten (10) hours following the game�s conclusion.
A protest in connection with a playoff game must be filed not later than ten (10) hours following
the game�s conclusion. A game may be protest may only be filed by a Governor, Alternate
Governor, General Manager, or Head Coach. The right of protest shall inure not only to the
immediately allegedly aggrieved contestants, but to any other Member who can show an interest
in the grounds of protest and the results that might be attained if the protest were allowed. No
protest shall be valid unless the Written Notice to the Commissioner thereof is accompanied by
a payment in the sum of $25,000 (the �Protest Fee�) payable to the Association. If the Member
filing the protest prevails, the Protest Fee is to be refunded. If the Member does not prevail, the
Protest Fee is to be forfeited and retained in the Association treasury.
�Upon receipt of a protest, the Commissioner shall at once notify the Member operating
the opposing team in the game protested and require both of said members within five (5) days
to file with him such evidence as he may desire bearing upon the issue. The Commissioner shall
decide the question raised within five (5) days after such evidence is due. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, for a protest in connection with a Playoff Game or any other situation where greater
expedition is required, the filing of evidence by Members and the Commissioner�s decision of
the question raised each shall occur on a schedule as determined by the Commissioner.�
G. SHATTERING BACKBOARDS
Any player whose contact with the basket ring or backboard causes the backboard to
shatter or makes the ring unplayable will be penalized in the following manner:
(1) Pre-game and/or halftime warm-ups�No penalty to be assessed by officials.
(2) During the game�non-unsportsmanlike conduct technical foul. Under no
circumstances will that player be ejected from the game.
The Commissioner will review all actions and plays involved in the shattering of
a backboard.
H. PLAYER/TEAM CONDUCT AND DRESS
(1) Each player when introduced, prior to the game, must be uniformly dressed.
(2) Players, coaches and trainers must stand and line up in a dignified posture along the
foul lines during the playing of the American and/or Canadian national anthems.
- 68 -(3) Players not in uniform (whether on the Active List or Inactive List) must wear dress
attire that is clean and neat in appearance (e.g., league approved team-issued apparel).
�Athleisure� (including, but not limited to, jogger pants, jumpsuits, sweatpants, etc.)
or similar attire is not permitted when seated on the bench during games (except that,
as previously noted, league approved team-issued apparel is permissible).
(4) While playing, players must keep their uniform shirts tucked into their pants, and
no T-shirts are allowed.
(5) The only article bearing a commercial �logo� which can be worn by players is
their shoes.
I. OFFENSIVE THREE-SECONDS
The offensive player cannot be allowed in the three-second lane for more than the
allotted time. This causes the defensive player to �hand-check� because he cannot control the
offensive player for that extended period of time.
If the offensive player is in the three-second lane for less than three seconds and
receives the ball, he must make a move toward the hoop for the official to discontinue his three
second count. If he attempts to back the defensive player down, attempting to secure a better
position in relation to the basket, offensive three seconds or an offensive foul must be called. If
he passes off and immediately makes a move out of the lane, there should be no whistle.
J. PLAYER CONDUCT�SPECTATORS
Any coach, player, trainer, or other team bench person who deliberately enters the
spectator stands during the game will be automatically ejected and the incident reported by
e-mail to Basketball Operations. Entering the stands to keep a ball in play by a player or the
momentum which carries the player into the stands is not considered deliberate. The first row of
seats is considered the beginning of the stands.
K. FIGHTING
Violent acts of any nature on the court will not be tolerated. Players involved in
altercations will be ejected, fined and/or suspended.
There is absolutely no justification for fighting in an NBA game. The fact that a player
may feel provoked by another person is not an acceptable excuse. If a player takes it upon
himself to retaliate, he can expect to be subject to appropriate penalties.
L. EXPIRATION OF TIME
NO LESS THAN :00.3 must expire on the game clock and shot clock when a ball
is thrown inbounds and then hit instantly out-of-bounds. If less than :00.3 expires in such a
situation, the timer will be instructed to deduct AT LEAST :00.3 from the game clock and shot
clock. If, in the judgment of the official, the play took longer than :00.3, he/she will instruct
the timer to deduct more time. If :00.3 or less remain on the game clock when this situation
occurs, the period is over. If :00.3 or less remain on the shot clock when this situation
occurs, a shot clock violation is called.
The game clock and shot clock must show :00.3 or more in order for a player to secure
possession of the ball on a rebound or throw-in to attempt a field goal. Instant replay shall be
utilized if the basket is successful on this type of play and the game clock runs to 0:00 or the
shot clock expires on a made basket and the officials are not reasonably certain that the ball
was released prior to the expiration of the shot clock. The only type of field goal which may be
scored if the game clock and shot clock are at :00.2 or :00.1 is a �tip-in� or �high lob.�
A �tip-in� is defined as any action in which the ball is deflected, not controlled, by a
player and then enters the basket ring. This type of action shall be deemed legal if :00.1 or
more remains in a period.
- 69 -A �high lob� is defined as a pass which is tipped by an offensive player while in mid-
air, and is followed instantaneously by a field goal attempt. If the reception of the pass and the
subsequent �slam dunk� is immediately adjacent to the basket ring, this type of action shall
be deemed legal if :00.1 or more remains in a period. However, if the �high lob� attempt
is a distance from the basket ring whereby the ball must be controlled in mid-air, either one-
handed or two-handed, a minimum of :00.3 is necessary for a field goal to score if successful.
Instant replay would NOT be used if the play starts with :00.2 or :00.1 on the game
clock or shot clock.NO LESS than :00.3 must expire on the game clock when a player secures
possession of an unsuccessful free throw attempt and immediately requests a timeout. If LESS
than :00.3 expires in such a circumstance, the time on the game clock shall be reduced by at
least :00.3. Therefore, if :00.3 OR LESS remain on the game clock when the above situation
exists, and a player requests a timeout upon securing possession of the ball, the period is over.
Regardless of when the horn or red light operates to signify the end of period, the
officials (as aided by instant replay, if required) will ultimately make the final decision whether
to allow or disallow a successful field goal. THE CREW CHIEF MUST TAKE CHARGE
OF THE SITUATION.
M. VERBAL FAN INTERFERENCE
Any spectator who verbally abuses players and/or coaches in a manner which, in the
opinion of the game officials, interferes with the ability of a coach to communicate with his
players during the game and/or huddles, will, at the direction of the crew chief, be given one
warning by a building security officer. If the same spectator continues to behave in a like manner,
the crew chief shall direct a building security officer to eject the spectator from the arena.
N. GUIDELINES FOR INFECTION CONTROL
In addition to any health- or safety-related rules established by the NBA, all NBA team
physicians, athletic trainers, equipment managers, and related personnel must comply with the
infection control procedures set forth below (in this Section N) in all NBA arenas, locker rooms,
training rooms, and practice facilities.
If a player suffers a laceration or a wound where bleeding occurs or if blood is visible on
a player or his uniform, the officials shall suspend the game at the earliest appropriate time and
allow a maximum of 30 seconds for treatment. After that time, the head coach shall be informed
that he has the option to substitute for the player or call a timeout. If a substitute replaces the
player, the opposing team shall be allowed to substitute one player. The bleeding player may
return to the game when he has received appropriate treatment by medical staff personnel.
A team will not be given an additional 30 seconds should the bleeding occur from a
wound which reopened, which is not the result of additional contact.
If the player returns to the game, the officials shall make certain that any lesion, wound
or dermatitis is covered with a dressing that will prevent contamination to and/or from other
sources. A wrist or sweat band is not considered a suitable bandage.
If the bleeding player is awarded a free throw attempt(s) as a result of a personal foul,
or is involved in a jump ball, the bleeding player will be given 30 seconds for treatment.
If the treatment is not completed, play will resume and will then be suspended at the first
appropriate time.
Mandatory timeouts shall not be granted during a suspension of play unless a team is
granted a timeout.
If treatment is not completed within the allotted time, the head coach may call another
timeout or substitute for the bleeding player. Substitutes are permitted consistent with existing
rules on substitution.
- 70 -If a team has no timeouts remaining when play is suspended, the officials will allow 30
seconds for appropriate treatment. If the treatment is not completed in accordance with para-
graph two above, the bleeding player must be removed immediately. ONLY the bleeding
player on that team may be removed from the game under these circumstances. If so, the
opponent may also substitute one player.
The offensive team will receive a full eight seconds to advance the ball into the front-
court. The shot clock will remain as is or reset to 14, whichever is greater.
O. DEAD BALL, LIVE BALL, BALL IS ALIVE
After the ball has been dead, it is put into play by a jump ball, throw-in or a free throw
attempt. The game clock does not start until the ball is legally touched on the court by a
player. However, any floor violation or personal foul which may occur will be penalized.
The ball is live when it is given to the thrower-in, free throw shooter or is tossed by the
official on a jump ball. Illegal contact, which occurs prior to the ball becoming live, will be
ignored if it is not unsportsmanlike or flagrant.
The ball is alive when it is legally tapped by one of the participants of a jump ball,
released by a thrower-in or released on a free throw attempt that will remain in play.
P. TAUNTING
If a player blatantly taunts an opponent, a technical foul shall be assessed. The
opponent WILL NOT, automatically, be assessed a technical foul. His behavior will be the
determining factor.
Simultaneous taunting is a verbal altercation. Verbal altercations and unsportsmanlike
conduct will be administered as a double technical foul and no free throws will be attempted.
Technical fouls assessed to opposing teams during the same dead ball and prior to the
administering of any free throw attempt for the first technical foul, shall be interpreted as a
double technical foul.
A PLAYER(S) GUILTY OF TAUNTING MUST BE SINGLED OUT AND PENALIZED.
If a previous unsportsmanlike act has been committed and if this situation is BLATANT,
a technical foul must be assessed and the guilty player(s) must be ejected.
Q. FLAGRANT FOUL CRITERIA
1. The severity of the contact;
2. Whether or not the player was making a legitimate basketball play (e.g., whether
a player is making a legitimate effort to block a shot; note, however, that a foul
committed during a block attempt can still be considered flagrant if other criteria are
present, such as recklessness and hard contact to the head);
3. Whether, on a foul committed with a player�s arm or hand, the fouling player
wound up and/or followed through after making contact;
4. The potential for injury resulting from contact (e.g., a blow to the head and a
foul committed while a player is in a vulnerable position);
5. The severity of any injury suffered by the offended player; and
6. The outcome of the contact (e.g., whether it led to an altercation).
